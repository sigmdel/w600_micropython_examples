# w600_micropython_examples
Simple MicroPython scripts on the Wemos W600-Pico development board.

---

:warning: **Warning** 2022-12-15

These scripts work with MicroPython version v1.10-282 preloaded on the W600-Pico. As pointed out by [LexxM3](https://github.com/sigmdel/w600_micropython_examples/issues/1), Robert Hammelrath (robert-hh) has not only ported MicroPython v1.19.1 to the W60X, but he also makes the `wm_w600*.fls` image files available in his [Shared-Stuff](https://github.com/robert-hh/Shared-Stuff) repository.

It would be best to use one of these newer versions of MicroPython.

This repository will be deleted or perhaps archived and replace with an updated version as soon as possible.

1. [restore_ftp](restore_ftp/restore_ftp.py)

    - Short MicroPython script easily copied and pasted at the REPL prompt to restore the FTP server. 
    - Adjust the Wi-Fi credentials and the static IP address to suit. 
    - See [5. The FTP Server](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/w600/first_look_w600_en.html#ftp).

1. [blink](blink/main.py)
    
    - Obligatory blink script flashing the on-board LED of the W600-Pico.
    - See [6. A Blink Example](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/w600/first_look_w600_en.htmll#blink).

1. [boot](boot/boot.py)

    - A custom `boot.py` script that connects to a Wi-Fi network and starts an FTP server.
    - Required for a workable programming environment.
    - Copy `boot.py` to the root directory of the W600 file system.
    - Adjust the content of [secrets.template](boot/secrets.template) and save as `secrets.py` alongside `boot.py`.
    - See [7. A Custom `boot.py`](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/w600/first_look_w600_en.htmll#boot_py).


1. [button](button/main.py)

    - Polling an I/O pin connected to a normally open push button.
    - [button.py](button/button.py) is a clone of [MicroPython-Button/Button.py](https://github.com/ubidefeo/MicroPython-Button) by Ubi de Feo (ubdefeo).
    - See [8. Polling a Button](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/w600/first_look_w600_en.htmll#workflow).

1. [mqtt](mqtt/main.py)

    - Implementing a simple Wi-Fi switch with MQTT capabilities.
    - Uses the [MicroPython-Button/Button.py](https://github.com/ubidefeo/MicroPython-Button) library by Ubi de Feo (ubdefeo).
    - Uses the [micropython-umqtt.simple2](https://github.com/fizista/micropython-umqtt.simple2) library by Wojciech Bana≈õ (fizista).
    - See [9. Wi-Fi Switch - Proof of Concept](http://localhost/michel/ha/w600/first_look_w600_en.htmll#wifi_switch).
